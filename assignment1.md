### Overal impression

It's a very bare-bone implementation of a pricing engine for car rentals.
It calculates the price based on each minute the car is rented.
The layout is very interesting as there is a lot of room for improvement.
The code is very easy to read and understand, which is a good thing.

### What I liked
- The code is very easy to read and understand
- There is no magic going on, everything is very explicit
- Found out you can use 'yield' in the tests, which is pretty cool

### What I puzzled over/would do differently
- Adjust the layout of the code to make it more readable and easier to understand
- Had to do a little research for the Brick/Money package
- Possibly would have changed the initial setup knowing the assignments I've given
